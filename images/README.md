**Note from Ryan:**   
This directory is an exact copy of uikit/src/images/.
Uikit is looking for its images in this directory and I end up with 404s
if I don't place it here. Perhaps this is a bug in the Uikit beta version,
or perhaps I've missed some configuration setting that corrects this.

Until this directory is no longer necessary, it must be updated with any
changes made to the uikit/src/images/ directory.
